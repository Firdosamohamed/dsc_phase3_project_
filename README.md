## Customer Churn Analysis
This repository contains the documentations and the codes on the customer churn analysis project that was done on SyriaTel company.
## The aim of the project. 
The project is aimed at detecting the customer patterns and come up with measures to mitigate the customer churn through drawing of insights and making recommendations to the stakeholders.
## Project overview
SyriaTel prides itself in provision of a wide range of services, including mobile, landline, and internet connectivity, to its customers. However, the company faces the menace of customer churn which is a problem that is witnessed across several other telecommunication companies.

## Business and data understanding.
The dataset used in this project is provided by SyriaTel. Special thanks to the open-source community for their valuable contributions to the libraries and tools used in this project. 
The stakeholders include marketing managers, customer  teams, and business executives. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from the kaggle and contains information on various customer attributes, such as demographic data, service usage, and customer interactions.
## Data preprocessing and cleaning.
here we perform preparation of the data and cleaned it then went ahead to do an exploratory data analysis. We then identified patterns and trends from our analysis
## Modeling.
 we built 4 predictive models using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees,kNN classifier and random forest. We started with a baseline logistic regression model, which is a widely-used algorithm for binary classification tasks. We further explored more advanced algorithms such as decision tree classifiers and random forests. Each model was trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics.
## Evaluation. 
we evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy and AUC . We used the performance of each model to determine the best model that we used as our final model. In our project we used Random forest classifier.
## Hyperparametr tuning.
 We tuned the best performing model's hyperparameters to increase its accuracy and also generalizability.
## Insights and recommendations 
* Improve Customer Service Quality: Focus on training customer service representatives to handle issues more effectively and efficiently. Aim to resolve customer issues on the first call to reduce the need for multiple interactions.
* Proactive Outreach: Implement a proactive customer service approach where representatives reach out to customers periodically to ensure satisfaction and address potential issues before they result in churn.
* Customer Feedback: Collect feedback after every customer service interaction and use this data to continuously improve service quality. Implement a follow-up mechanism to ensure the customerâ€™s issue was resolved satisfactorily.
* Evaluate International Plan Pricing: Review the pricing structure of international plans to ensure they are competitive and offer good value. Consider offering discounted rates or bundling international minutes with other services.
* Targeted Promotions: Create special offers or promotions for customers with international plans to increase their satisfaction and loyalty.
* Monitor Usage Patterns: Analyze the usage patterns of international plan subscribers to identify any dissatisfaction points and address them promptly.
* Localized Promotions: Develop targeted marketing campaigns and promotions specifically for customers in area code 415 to improve retention.
* Community Engagement: Engage with local communities through events, sponsorships, and partnerships to build a stronger brand presence and customer loyalty.
* Competitive Analysis: Conduct a competitive analysis in the area to understand why customers might be churning and address those factors, such as better pricing, offers, or service quality from competitors.
* Incentivize Voicemail Plans: Offer incentives for customers to add a voicemail plan, such as discounts or bundled packages that include voicemail at a reduced rate.
* Highlight Benefits: Communicate the benefits of having a voicemail plan, such as increased convenience and better call management.
* Free Trial: Provide a free trial period for the voicemail plan to encourage customers to try the service and experience its value.
##  Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to customer churn. By examining customer behavior and service attributes, several key factors have been identified,this was achieved by fitting models which provided a clear predictive power on customers churn as well as identifying important features.Based on these insights,I have  recommended strategies to reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction
