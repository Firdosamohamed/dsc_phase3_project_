## Customer Churn Analysis
This repository contains the documentations and the codes on the customer churn analysis project that was done on SyriaTel company. The aim of the project. The project is aimed at detecting the customer patterns and come up with measures to mitigate the customer churn through drawing of insights and making recommendations to the stakeholders.
##Project overview
SyriaTel prides itself in provision of a wide range of services, including mobile, landline, and internet connectivity, to its customers. However, the company faces the menace of customer churn which is a problem that is witnessed across several other telecommunication companies.

## Business and data understanding.
The dataset used in this project is provided by SyriaTel. Special thanks to the open-source community for their valuable contributions to the libraries and tools used in this project. 
The stakeholders include marketing managers, customer  teams, and business executives. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from the kaggle and contains information on various customer attributes, such as demographic data, service usage, and customer interactions.
## Data preprocessing and cleaning.
here we perform preparation of the data and cleaned it then went ahead to do an exploratory data analysis. We then identified patterns and trends from our analysis
## Modeling.
 we built 4 predictive models using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees,kNN classifier and random forest. We started with a baseline logistic regression model, which is a widely-used algorithm for binary classification tasks. We further explored more advanced algorithms such as decision tree classifiers and random forests. Each model was trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics.
## Evaluation. 
we evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision etc. We used the performance of each model to determine the best model that we used as our final model. In our project we used Random forest classifier.
Hyperparametr tuning. We tuned the best performing model's hyperparameters to increase its accuracy and also generalizability.
Insights and recommendations - here we drew insights from the exploratory data analysis and provided data-driven recommendations to the stakeholders to help mitigate the challenge of churning.
conclusion - In conclusion, the analysis of the customer churn in SyriaTel has provided clear knowledge on the factors that leads to churning of the customers as well as valuable insights into the customer behaviors. The models have provided a clear predictive power on customers churn as well as identifying important features that greatly influence customer retention. We found that customer service calls, total evening and day charges, international plan subscription and also voice mail plan are key factors influencing customer churn.
