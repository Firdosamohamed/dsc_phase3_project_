The industry is now experiencing severe competition, thus client retention is critical for sustaining corporate revenue development. Customer churn study will assist us in identifying the factors that contribute to customer attrition. This will allow for the execution of steps that will assist reduce the number of clients who discontinue utilizing the company's services. The stakeholder audience here includes the data analytics team, sales team, senior management, and marketing executives."
